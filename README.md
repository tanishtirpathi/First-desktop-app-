## 🌟 Features

### 🎨 Aesthetic Dark UI  
- Transparent, glassy look with soft shadows and animated blur effects.  
- Focus-friendly — blends beautifully with your desktop.

### ✅ Smart Checklist Logic  
- Checkbox auto-inserts with `Shift + Enter`.  
- `Enter` adds a normal new line.  
- Checked tasks get auto-strikethrough and move to the bottom.  
- Live checkbox sync even as you edit.

### 📝 Fully Editable Task Area  
- No separate input fields — your entire task list is a content-editable box.  
- Add, reorder, or modify tasks naturally like writing in a notepad.

### 🖋️ Rich Text Styling  
- Font dropdown with aesthetic choices.  
- Apply **bold**, *italic*, or _underline_ to selected words.  
- Bullet point support with `Shift + B`.

### 🌈 Attention to Detail  
- Cute, custom scrollbars.  
- Blur transitions on interaction.  
- Lightweight and responsive — even with long task lists.
